Ciro Mattia's Fritzing Library
==========================

A library of parts for [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/)

Each part is in the form of an .FZPZ file, which is a standard .ZIP file
generated by Fritzing.
They contain all the SVG images and the FPZ part file, and can be opened with a 
standard archive utility like 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org/)
